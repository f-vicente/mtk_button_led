    <string name="how_to">This application turns on the LED of the buttons of your phone.\n
        First check that the buttons can be turned on/off with the buttons (it will request ROOT, as is needed to make this).\n
        Then go to the Accessibility settings (or click the button down), and turn on MTKButtonLed (it will advise that it could be dangerous, but is the best way to catch notifications).\n
        And that\'s all, when you turn off the screen, the buttons will light when a new notification occurs.\n
